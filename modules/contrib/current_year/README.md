   that accepts formatted text).

   warranty (implied or otherwise) as to its fitness for a particular purpose.

## REQUIREMENTS

## CONFIGURATION

 - Choose a text format that you want to be able to display the current year.
   In the list of Enabled Filters for that format, check "Current Year". If
   necessary, rearrange the Filter Processing Order to avoid problems.

 - To see the current year in formatted text, ensure the text uses a format that
   has this filter enabled. Simply type the token "&year;" wherever you'd like
   to see the current year displayed.
